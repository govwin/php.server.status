## Raspberry Pi
### Temperature
If when running `vcgencmd` on a **raspberry pi** you get VCHI initialization failed then you need to add the video group to your user. The `vcgencmd` tool requires you have this group role so without it, it will give `VCHI initialization failed` error.
```
sudo usermod -aG video www-data
```
### Netstat
If `Service status` shows empty column **Service** for many rows then do: `sudo visudo`
add line
```
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/bin/netstat
```
